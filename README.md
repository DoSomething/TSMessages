We forked to [alter the `TSMessageViewMinimumPadding` defined in `TSMessageView.m`](https://github.com/DoSomething/TSMessages/commit/5239c476868e624773786eab53400c1d4ed7a28d) from 15 to 10.

We would have loved to submit a pull request to add a `[TSMessageView] public method` to set this property, but the library is no [longer maintained](https://github.com/KrauseFx/TSMessages/issues/242#issuecomment-124194456).
